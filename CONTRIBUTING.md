# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! For bug fixes, typos in comments and other incredibly minor changes, just directly open a pull request.
For new features or other larger changes, an issue should be opened first.
This is to confirm the change is appropriate, some advice is given about implementation details and to avoid duplication of effort.

In either case, commits should be signed (`git commit -S`) to confirm your right to submit changes merged into this project and
those changes will be licensed under this project's open-source license(s).
This is to comply with [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) requirements.
In the future, DCO signatures may be enforced by a CI check.
